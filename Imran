Hello everyone i am Imran. I was really happy for the speed and effective manner in which we were able to accomplish this assume.
we got all the work done quicker this time by applying our skills obtained in previous classes and assignments. I was able to write a report
on the set up for the raspberry pi. This was my biggest challenge. I wasn't able to get the skills needed for the first two attempts.
these are all skills i will ise in future work fields and related things to programming and development.
